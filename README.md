# ðŸ“š Computer Book for starters

This project is a **computer-book-for-kids** built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, where the content is written in **Markdown**. It provides a clean and dynamic way to navigate chapters from a sidebar, and the main content updates dynamically without reloading the page.
